## World of Elyndor

### The Cataclysm and Crystal Shards

Five centuries ago, the primordial Cataclysm shattered the crystal that bound reality together into seven powerful shards. These shards scattered across the world of Elyndor, each containing immense magical power. The Cataclysm caused massive destruction, reshaping the continents and awakening ancient evils that now threaten to consume the world.

### The Prophecy

> "When the seven shards are reunited, the Crystal Heart will awaken, and with it, either salvation or eternal darkness."

### Item and Equipment Balance

#### Weapon Damage Formula
```
Base Damage = 10 + (level - 1) × 2.5
Rarity Multiplier: Common (1.0), Uncommon (1.2), Rare (1.5), Epic (2.0), Legendary (3.0)
Final Damage = Base Damage × Rarity Multiplier
```

#### Armor Defense Formula
```
Base Defense = 5 + (level - 1) × 2
Rarity Multiplier: Same as weapons
Final Defense = Base Defense × Rarity Multiplier
```

#### Item Value Calculation
```
Base Value = level × 25
Rarity Multiplier: Same as above
Final Value = Base Value × Rarity Multiplier
```

### Enemy and Boss Scaling

#### Standard Enemy Scaling
- **Health**: 50 + (level - 1) × 25
- **Attack**: 8 + (level - 1) × 3
