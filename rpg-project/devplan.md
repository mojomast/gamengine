class SceneManager {
    scenes = {
        'title': TitleScene,
        'world': WorldScene, 
        'battle': BattleScene,
        'menu': MenuScene,
        'cutscene': CutsceneScene
    };
    
    transition(sceneName, data) {
        // Handle scene transitions with loading
    }
}
```

### 3. Data Management
```javascript
// Data structure for game objects
const GameData = {
    characters: new Map(),
    items: new Map(),
    spells: new Map(),
    maps: new Map(),
    quests: new Map(),
    dialogs: new Map()
};
